This repository contains the necessary **Ansible** playbooks, **Discord bot** source, and configuration needed to run my private on-demand **Minecraft server** for my friends.

But not running the server all the time I can significantly reduce costs to only **2â‚¬** per month running on **CPX11** instance.

## ðŸ›  How It Works

Friends of mine can request a server using a self-hosted Discord bot.

It then triggers GitHub Action workflow running Ansible playbook against Hetzner cloud.

Playbook rents a VPS, updates DNS entry for minecraft.bednarski.dev, configures Minecraft server with Nginx reverse proxy and custom monitoring endpoint.

For world persistence, I am using Hetzner block volume.
